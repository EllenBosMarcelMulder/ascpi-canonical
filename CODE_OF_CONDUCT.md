# Code of Conduct — ASCπ Community

## Purpose

The ASCπ project exists to provide a **stable, deterministic foundation** for a field-based computational paradigm.  
A healthy community is essential to preserve clarity, integrity, and long-term usefulness.

This Code of Conduct defines the behavioral expectations for all participants.

All community members are expected to:
