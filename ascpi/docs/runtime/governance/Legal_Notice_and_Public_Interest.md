# Legal Notice & Public Interest Context

This repository documents a deterministic computational system designed with:

- strict reproducibility
- complete auditability
- absence of stochastic or learning-based behavior
- verifiable state transitions

Such properties are commonly relevant in public-sector contexts where
decision traceability, accountability and non-arbitrary system behavior
are required by law or policy.

This document does not assert obligations on any institution.
It serves solely as an informational notice of technical characteristics
and potential public-interest relevance.
