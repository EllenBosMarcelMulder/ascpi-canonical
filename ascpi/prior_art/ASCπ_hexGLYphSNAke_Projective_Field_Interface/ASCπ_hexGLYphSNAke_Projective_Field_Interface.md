## ASCπ hexGLYphSNAke Projective Field Interface

### Canonical Geometric Projection of a Semantic Field Law

**Author / Originator:** Marcel C. Mulder
**Date of Fixation:** 13 December 2025
**Status:** Canonically sealed – Prior Art disclosure
**Scope:** Projective Layer (P), hexGLYphSNAke Injection Mechanism, Field-Isomorphic GUI Architecture

---

## 1. Statement of Prior Art

This document discloses a **novel computing and interface paradigm** in which a graphical interface is not a representation of a computational process, but an **isomorphic geometric manifestation of a field law**.

The disclosed system defines a **Projective Field Interface** that:

* does not execute the field law,
* does not evolve state,
* does not simulate time or causality,
* but is **structurally identical** (isomorphic) to the mathematical field space it mirrors.

This disclosure establishes prior art for:

* field-isomorphic graphical interfaces,
* discrete glyph-driven topological injection,
* non-temporal projection stacks,
* and self-validating geometric projection via mirrored parity domains.

---

## 2. Fundamental Separation of Concerns (Canonical Invariant)

The architecture is divided into three strictly separated domains:

1. Motor Layer (Field Law Execution)
2. Injection Layer (Symbolic Discrete Interaction)
3. Projection Layer (Geometric Manifestation)

This document concerns **only** domains 2 and 3.

No component described herein:

* executes the motor,
* mutates the field state,
* advances time,
* or commits state transitions.

Violation of this separation breaks canonical validity.

---

## 3. The Field State Ψ (Reference Only)

The field is defined abstractly by the state vector:

Ψ = { ΔΦ, κ, θ, C, N, t }

Where:

* ΔΦ = field tension relative to the canonical attractor
* κ = curvature (non-Euclidean metric parameter)
* θ = phase / orientation
* C = coherence (unitless convergence measure)
* N = energy / contextual scale
* t = discrete motor step index

In the Projective Layer, **Ψ₀ is immutable**.

Ψ₀ functions exclusively as a **visual and geometric reference**, never as a mutable computational state.

---

## 4. Projective Isomorphy (Core Invention)

### Axiom P1 — Projective Identity

The Projective Layer P is not a visualization of Ψ.

P is geometrically isomorphic to Ψ.

Formally:

P ≡ Ψ

This equivalence is **structural**, not dynamic.

---

### Axiom P2 — Metric Preservation

The Projective Layer does not use Euclidean metrics.

Each geometric degree of freedom corresponds 1-to-1 with a field relation:

Distance ↔ κ (Curvature)
Angle ↔ θ (Phase)
Scale ↔ N (Context / Energy)
Intersection Point ↔ ΔΦ* (Canonical Attractor)

Thus, geometric operations are **field operations**, not camera operations.

---

## 5. hexGLYphSNAke Injection Mechanism

### Definition

hexGLYphSNAke is a **discrete, symbolic, non-temporal injection mechanism**.

It is not:

* continuous input,
* gesture tracking,
* animation,
* simulation,
* or control flow.

It is a **glyph-defined topological activation** on a hexagonal decision manifold.

---

### Axiom G1 — Discreteness

All injections are discrete.

There is no continuous parameter manipulation.

---

### Axiom G2 — Hexagonal Canonical Facets

The decision manifold is hexagonal.

Phase orientation is quantized as:

θ = k · (π / 3)
where k ∈ {0,1,2,3,4,5}

The user never sets θ directly.
θ is implied by glyph selection.

---

### Axiom G3 — Injection Without Mutation

A glyph injection:

* does not modify Ψ₀,
* does not advance t,
* does not commit state.

It produces only a **temporary projective stack**.

---

## 6. The Projective Stack (Non-Temporal)

### Definition

A projective stack is a finite, symmetric set of projected field states:

Ψᵢ = Ψ₀ + ΔΨᵢ

Where:

* ΔΨᵢ is defined relative to a glyph injection,
* Ψᵢ exists only in the projection layer,
* Ψᵢ has no causal ordering.

The stack is **not time**, **not evolution**, **not simulation**.

---

### Axiom S1 — Symmetry

Stacks are symmetric around Ψ₀:

i ∈ { −n, … , 0 , … , +n }

Ψ₀ remains dominant and immutable.

---

### Axiom S2 — Projective Variations Only

Variations in κ and C inside the stack are:

* explicitly projective,
* visual and semantic only,
* forbidden from feeding back into Ψ₀.

Formally:

dΨ₀ / d(projective stack) = 0

---

## 7. Pan, Tilt, Zoom as Field Operations

Pan, tilt, and zoom are **not camera controls**.

They are redefinitions of the **intersection plane** within the field.

---

### Pan (Translation)

Pan = translation of the observation slice
Pan ≠ movement in space
Pan = change of reference frame within Ψ

---

### Tilt (Rotation)

Tilt = projective rotation of the slice
Tilt ↔ θ
Tilt does not commit phase

---

### Zoom (Scale)

Zoom = change in contextual resolution
Zoom ↔ N
Zoom does not change distance

---

## 8. Dual Projection and Parity Inversion

### Axiom M1 — Dual Projection Domains

The Projective Layer must support two simultaneous projections:

* Projection A: direct orientation
* Projection B: parity-inverted orientation

Both share the same Ψ₀.

---

### Axiom M2 — Crossed Intersection (Topological Anchor)

Projection A and B intersect at a second invariant point:

This point is defined as:

ΔΦ_A = ΔΦ_B = ΔΦ*

This crossed intersection:

* enforces coherence,
* provides self-validation,
* closes the projective field loop.

No additional data is introduced.

---

## 9. Absence of Dynamics (Explicit Prohibition)

The Projective Layer:

* does not evolve,
* does not integrate,
* does not simulate,
* does not predict.

All motion is **geometric re-indexing**, never temporal change.

Any system violating this constraint is **not** covered by this prior art.

---

## 10. Formal Canonical Sealing

This document:

* closes version 0.2 definitively,
* defines version 0.3 architecturally,
* establishes protected prior art for:

  * field-isomorphic interfaces,
  * glyph-based topological injection,
  * mirrored projective validation,
  * non-temporal projection stacks.

The GUI is hereby defined as a **geometric field object**,
not as an interface layer in the conventional sense.
