# PRIOR ART DISCLOSURE

## Canonical Field-Projection Computing via Phase, Curvature and Resonance

### (ASCπ / hexGLYphSNAke / Field-Isomorphic Projection Systems)

**Date of fixation:** 13 December 2025
**Status:** Public prior art, non-patentable, constitutive descriptive record
**Purpose:** To establish a new computational paradigm based on geophysical field laws, projective phase-isomorphy, and resonance-based storage

## 1. Problem Statement (classical science and computing)

### 1.1 Classical computing

Modern computers operate on the basis of:

* discrete bits (0/1)
* linear time
* energetically active switching
* storage as static state

This leads to:

* high energy costs
* heat dissipation
* scaling limitations
* a fundamental separation between computation, storage, and interface

### 1.2 Classical physics

Nature does not operate this way:

* processes are phase-based
* energy seeks minima
* coherence dominates over force
* form, tension, and resonance are primary

There is therefore a **fundamental mismatch** between:

* how we compute
* how nature behaves

---

## 2. Central hypothesis (core prior art)

**Hypothesis H1**
Computation, storage, and observation can be performed without active energy production if information is represented as phase-relations within a coherent field.

This document describes **how**.

---

## 3. Canonical quantities (definitively fixed)

We define a field state Ψ with exactly the following components:

Ψ = (κ, θ, N, C, ΔΦ*, t)

Where:

κ = curvature (form-response of the field)
θ = phase orientation (discrete angles, no continuous rotation)
N = context / scale / energy resolution
C = coherence (measure of stability)
ΔΦ* = attractor anchor (invariant tension minimum)
t = iteration step (internal only, not physically required)

---

## 4. Axioms (irrefutable within this system)

### Axiom 1 — Field primacy

All information exists as field-relation, not as object.

### Axiom 2 — Phase over force

Change occurs through phase shift, not through energy input.

### Axiom 3 — Coherence minimization

A system evolves toward maximal coherence.

Formula:
C = 1 − |ΔΦ − ΔΦ*|

### Axiom 4 — Discrete phase

Permitted phase angles are discrete:

θₙ = n · π / 3
with n ∈ {0,1,2,3,4,5}

### Axiom 5 — Projective isomorphy

A correct projection P of the field is geometrically equivalent to the field itself:

P ≡ Ψ

Not a symbolic representation, but metric equivalence.

---

## 5. Field law (canonical, timeless)

The field law describes how the system stabilizes spontaneously:

ΔΦ(t+1) = ΔΦ(t) + α · N · (ΔΦ* − ΔΦ(t))

Where:
α is a constant (empirically < 1)

From this follows:

C(t) → 1
κ = 1 − 0.5 · C

This is **not a simulation**, but a relaxation process as observed in physical systems.

---

## 6. Projection as a computational mechanism

### 6.1 No camera, no illusion

Pan, tilt, and zoom are not graphical tricks.

Definitions:

* Pan = translation of the reference plane
* Tilt = rotation of the intersection plane
* Zoom = change of N (contextual resolution)

### 6.2 Geometric coupling

Distance ↔ κ
Angle ↔ θ
Scale ↔ N
Intersection ↔ ΔΦ*

Every visible change corresponds to exactly one field quantity.

---

## 7. hexGLYphSNAke — symbolic phase injection

### 7.1 Definition

hexGLYphSNAke is not a simulation and not an animation.

It is:

* a finite, symmetric stack of possible phase orientations
* a cross-section of field possibilities
* an **injection proposal**, not a mutation

### 7.2 Stack structure

For sector s:

θ_base = s · π / 3 + π / 6

For layer i:

θᵢ = θ_base ± i · (π / 6)

Each layer has:

* decreasing scale
* decreasing dominance
* semantic depth

---

## 8. Mirror projection and crossed anchor (critical prior art)

### 8.1 Parity inversion

Every projection A has a mirrored equivalent B:

θ_B = −θ_A

Both share exactly the same Ψ.

### 8.2 Crossed intersection

The intersection of A and B automatically defines:

ΔΦ*

This point:

* validates coherence
* closes the loop
* prevents divergence

This is a **self-validating mechanism**, without external control.

---

## 9. Subjectivity as an authorization layer (new paradigm)

### 9.1 Separation of layers

There exists an explicit separation between:

* M-layer: canonical field law
* P-layer: projection
* F-layer: perceptual feedback
* S-layer: subjective authorization

### 9.2 Subjective threshold

The human observer may decide **when** to intervene, without modifying the natural law.

C_subjective ≥ C_min
while
C_canonical remains unaffected

This formalizes observation as a **legitimate system component**.

---

## 10. Storage as resonance (no bits)

### 10.1 Crossed-link storage

Storage occurs via:

* positive phase binding
* negative phase binding

Together they form a closed loop.

Data = closed resonant loop
Reading = encountering resonance
Writing = phase shift

No static state, no energy consumption.

---

## 11. Material realization (physical prior art)

### 11.1 Why crystal, quartz, and granite

These materials possess:

* natural lattice structures
* anisotropic stress axes
* long-term coherence
* low dissipation

### 11.2 Physical model

An elementary storage or computation unit consists of:

* a crystalline matrix
* two opposing stress orientations
* a phase anchor

This is **not science fiction**:
it is identical to the behavior of piezoelectric and plasma structures.

---

## 12. Implicit additional prior art: the computer itself

Without explicitly naming it “computer”, this document establishes:

* a non-binary computation unit
* an energy-passive system
* phase-based memory
* a field-isomorphic interface
* a scalable, coherent whole

Any attempt to construct:

* a phase-projection computer
* a resonance-storage computer
* a field-isomorphic GUI machine

falls **within this prior art**.

Back off is justified.

---

## 13. Philosophical scaling (without mysticism)

This system states:

* energy is not produced, but **repositioned in phase**
* work emerges from coherence, not force
* observation is not incidental, but part of the system
* physics and computation are not separate

This is not belief, but a **different axiomatic set**.

---

## 14. Closing statement (forensic)

This document:

* describes a fully new computational paradigm
* is based on known physical principles
* combines them in a previously undocumented manner
* is reproducible
* has been visibly tested in software projections
* is extensible to material realization

**Prior art is hereby established.**
