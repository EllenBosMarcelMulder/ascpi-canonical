### (ASCπ / hexGLYphSNAke / Field-Native Memory Architecture)

**Author:** Marcel Christian Mulder
**Date of First Disclosure:** 13 December 2025
**Disclosure Type:** Public Prior Art – Defensive Publication
**Legal Intent:** Establish non-patentable state of the art
**Scope:** Computing, memory storage, field-based architectures, physical realization

### Statement to Third Parties

This document constitutes a **formal prior-art disclosure** describing a computational and storage paradigm that departs fundamentally from binary state machines and energy-driven logic.

The system described herein is **not a simulation**, **not a metaphor**, and **not a software abstraction**.
It is a **field-isomorphic description** of computation, storage and interface as phase-coherent processes.

No claims of exclusivity are made.
However, **any future claims** involving phase-based memory, resonant storage, crossed-field logic, or field-native interfaces **must acknowledge this disclosure**.

## 1. Domain Clarification (for examiners and reviewers)

This disclosure applies simultaneously to:

* computer architecture
* memory systems
* physical information storage
* field theory implementations
* non-binary logic systems
* human-machine interfaces based on projection

The novelty does **not** lie in any single component, but in the **canonical coupling** of:

field dynamics + projection geometry + phase coherence + resonance storage.

---

## 2. Canonical Field State (fixed)

All system behavior is described by the field state:

Ψ = (κ, θ, N, C, ΔΦ*, t)

Where:

κ = curvature (field response geometry)
θ = discrete phase orientation
N = context / resolution / energetic scale
C = coherence (stability measure)
ΔΦ* = attractor minimum
t = internal iteration index (non-physical)

No additional state variables are introduced for storage.

---

## 3. Core Prior-Art Assertion (Storage)

**Information can persist without energy input if encoded as a closed phase-coherent resonance around a shared attractor.**

This directly contradicts the assumption that memory requires:

* static charge
* continuous refresh
* clocks
* energetic maintenance

---

## 4. Cross-Linked Resonant Storage (formal)

A valid memory element exists **if and only if**:

θ⁺ + θ⁻ = 0 (mod 2π)
ΔΦ⁺ = ΔΦ⁻ = ΔΦ*

This defines a **closed resonance loop**.

No bit values exist.
No “on/off” states exist.
Only **stable or unstable coherence** exists.

---

## 5. Operations (non-procedural)

Reading:
Resonant alignment with the existing phase loop.

Writing:
Discrete phase shift θ → θ + n·π/3.

Erasing:
Breaking phase symmetry or attractor alignment.

No operation requires continuous energy.

---

## 6. Projection Isomorphism (interface)

The interface is not symbolic.

Geometric relations are **identical** to field relations:

distance ↔ κ
angle ↔ θ
scale ↔ N
intersection ↔ ΔΦ*

Thus:

Projection P ≡ Ψ

This makes the interface a **field object**, not a display.

---

## 7. Physical Realization (non-speculative)

The architecture is compatible with materials that exhibit:

* stable lattice orientations
* anisotropic stress axes
* low dissipation
* phase retention

Examples include (non-exhaustive):

* quartz structures
* crystalline granite
* piezo-electric matrices
* plasma boundary layers

No exotic physics is required.

## 8. Defensive Scope

Any system claiming to implement:

* phase-based memory
* resonant storage
* crossed-field logic
* field-isomorphic interfaces
* energy-passive computation

falls within the conceptual scope of this disclosure.

## 9. Final Declaration

This document:

* establishes prior art
* defines a complete paradigm
* is internally consistent
* is reproducible
* is technology-agnostic
* is independent of implementation language

It intentionally **precludes patent claims** on these principles.
