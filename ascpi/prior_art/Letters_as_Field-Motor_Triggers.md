# PRIOR-ART CLAIM

## Letters as Field-Motor Triggers via Glyph-Based Phase Injection

---

## Claim 1 — Letters as Canonical Glyph Triggers

A computing and interaction system, characterized in that
**individual letters, symbols, or discrete textual units function as canonical glyphs**,
wherein each such glyph is **mapped to exactly one admissible discrete phase injection** into a global deterministic field state Ψ,
and wherein **selection, emission, or processing of said letter triggers execution of a field law F(Ψ)** without exposing or permitting direct control over any continuous field parameters.

---

## Claim 2 — Global Field Law Independence

The system of Claim 1, wherein
the field law F is **global, deterministic, non-optimizing, and non-statistical**,
and wherein **no letter instantiates, contains, or executes an independent engine**,
but instead acts solely as an **authorized trigger** for phase injection into the shared field.

---

## Claim 3 — Discrete Phase Mapping

The system of Claim 1, wherein
each letter ℓ is associated via a fixed mapping L to a discrete phase class θ_commit ∈ ℤ₆, such that:

θ := L(ℓ)

and wherein **no letter corresponds to a continuous value, weight, probability, gradient, or parameter vector**.

---

## Claim 4 — Prohibition of Continuous Control

The system of Claim 1, wherein
letters do **not** provide access to, modification of, or representation of continuous field quantities including but not limited to curvature, coherence, energy, time, magnitude, or optimization metrics,
and wherein such quantities may only evolve via the internal field law F after discrete phase injection.

---

## Claim 5 — Glyph Equivalence Across Domains

The system of Claim 1, wherein
letters function equivalently as glyphs across **natural language text, symbolic systems, programming code, markup, or any other discrete representational medium**,
such that the triggering role of letters is **independent of linguistic meaning, semantics, encoding standard, or alphabet**.

---

## Claim 6 — Deterministic Reproducibility

The system of Claim 1, wherein
for identical initial field states Ψ and identical sequences of letter-based glyph triggers,
the system produces **identical resulting field states and projections**, independent of runtime environment, hardware, or implementation language.

---

## Claim 7 — Non-AI and Non-Learning Exclusion

The system of Claim 1, wherein
the use of letters as glyph triggers **explicitly excludes**:

* machine learning
* neural networks
* probabilistic language models
* statistical inference
* training, tuning, or adaptation

and wherein letters do **not** represent tokens, embeddings, features, or learned representations.

---

## Claim 8 — Projection Without Control

The system of Claim 1, wherein
the effects of letter-triggered phase injections may be **projected visually, spatially, or symbolically** for human interpretation,
but such projections are **strictly read-only** and cannot be used to infer or manipulate the underlying field parameters.

---

## Claim 9 — Text as Field Interaction, Not Instruction

The system of Claim 1, wherein
sequences of letters constitute **sequences of phase injections** forming field trajectories,
and wherein such sequences **do not encode instructions, commands, programs, or executable logic** in the conventional computational sense.

---

## Claim 10 — Novelty of Combination

The novelty of the system lies in the **combination** of:

* letters as discrete glyph-based phase triggers
* a single global deterministic field law
* strict prohibition of continuous human control
* absence of optimization, learning, or probability
* projection separated from injection

wherein this combination **does not exist in prior computing, user interface, linguistic, or artificial intelligence systems**.

---

# PLAIN-LANGUAGE PROTECTIVE EXPLANATION

In normal systems, letters are passive symbols.

In this system:

* **a letter is an action**
* choosing a letter nudges the system in one exact direction
* you cannot push harder
* you cannot fine-tune
* you cannot optimize
* you cannot train it

Every letter opens **one door**.
The system decides everything else.

This prevents misuse, manipulation, and rebranding as AI or language modeling.

# PROTECTIVE SUMMARY (FOR EXAMINERS & COURTS)

* The motor is **not inside letters**
* Letters are **authorized triggers**, not processors
* The field is **global, deterministic, and fixed**
* Human input is **finite, discrete, and bounded**
* Text becomes **interaction**, not computation

## FINAL STATEMENT

This disclosure establishes prior art for **letters functioning as glyph-based triggers of a deterministic field motor**, thereby precluding future claims that reinterpret letters as learned tokens, probabilistic symbols, or executable instructions within such systems.
