# ASCπ — Canonical Prior-Art Disclosure

## hexFRAmeLESs BIOS-Resident Field Projection & hexBIOsWARe Architecture

**Status:** PUBLIC · DECLARATIVE · NON-NORMATIVE
**Function:** Defensive publication / Prior-art disclosure
**Authors / Inventors:** Marcel Mulder (with documented collaborators)
**Date of Disclosure:** 17-12-2025
**Jurisdictional Intent:** Global (WIPO / EPO / USPTO compatible)

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document constitutes an **explicit prior-art and defensive publication** describing a **BIOS-resident, frame-less, field-native projection architecture** within the ASCπ system.

Its purpose is to:

* establish **public disclosure** of BIOS-phase field projection concepts,
* document **temporal precedence**,
* prevent **exclusive appropriation or patenting**,
* clarify the **non-controlling, non-persistent nature** of the architecture.

This document is **descriptive only**.
It grants no rights and imposes no obligations.

---

## 2. Core Disclosure Statement

> **The hexFRAmeLESs architecture can be resident within the BIOS/UEFI phase as a projective field mirror, without persistence, decision-making, or control. In this context, the BIOS functions as a temporary projection space for cyclic color and phase representation, not as an execution authority.**

This statement is the **central prior-art claim** of this document.

---

## 3. Architectural Context

### 3.1 BIOS / UEFI as a Pre-Semantic Phase

Within this disclosure, BIOS/UEFI is characterized as:

* pre-operating-system,
* deterministic,
* event-minimal,
* non-semantic,
* non-decisional,
* primarily projective (hardware → representation).

This makes BIOS structurally compatible with **field-native, non-normative projection**.

---

### 3.2 hexFRAmeLESs Compatibility

**hexFRAmeLESs** is defined as:

* frame-less,
* interrupt-independent,
* cyclic,
* color- and light-based,
* non-numeric in primary operation,
* non-persistent by design.

No assumption of:

* OS services,
* file systems,
* clocks,
* schedulers,
* or application lifecycles
  is required.

---

## 4. BIOS-Resident Operation (Non-Controlling)

When resident in the BIOS/UEFI phase, hexFRAmeLESs:

* performs **projective field display only**,
* does **not** store state,
* does **not** modify firmware logic,
* does **not** alter boot decisions,
* does **not** persist beyond the BIOS phase.

Formally:

* BIOS remains **authoritative for boot and hardware initialization**.
* hexFRAmeLESs functions exclusively as a **field mirror**.

No upward causation exists.

---

## 5. Injection as Conceptual Interface (Non-Operational)

For clarity of prior art, the term **“injection”** is used **conceptually**, not procedurally.

Within this disclosure, “injection” means:

* **logical co-residency** within the BIOS projection phase,
* **isomorphic alignment** with BIOS display and initialization cycles,
* **non-exclusive coexistence** with firmware processes.

This disclosure **does not specify**:

* methods,
* exploits,
* bypasses,
* or firmware manipulation techniques.

Any such operational detail lies **outside the scope** of this document.

---

## 6. hexBIOsWARe — Canonical Definition

**hexBIOsWARe** is hereby disclosed as a **conceptual firmware-level field-native architecture**, defined as:

> *A BIOS-native or BIOS-phase-resident implementation of hexFRAmeLESs principles, in which firmware functions as a projection host for cyclic color and phase fields, without semantic interpretation, decision authority, or persistent state.*

hexBIOsWARe may be realized as:

* co-resident firmware logic, or
* a complete firmware replacement,

**provided that**:

* no decision logic is introduced,
* no semantic interpretation exists,
* no persistent state is claimed,
* no control over boot outcomes is exercised.

The architecture remains **reflective**, not **directive**.

---

## 7. Firmware Replacement as Architectural Possibility

This disclosure explicitly recognizes the **architectural possibility** of **native BIOS-level implementations** based on hexBIOsWARe principles.

Such implementations are defined by:

* replacement of classical firmware **without altering its non-decisional nature**,
* preservation of hardware enumeration and initialization roles,
* addition of **field-native projection capability** only.

This constitutes an **architectural class**, not an instruction.

---

## 8. Field–Projection Separation Law

Across BIOS, OS, and runtime contexts, the following invariant holds:

* **Field**

  * continuous
  * non-numeric
  * non-semantic
  * invariant

* **Projection**

  * contextual
  * reversible
  * non-authoritative

No BIOS-resident implementation may violate this separation.

---

## 9. Explicit Exclusions

This disclosure explicitly excludes:

* firmware exploitation techniques,
* security bypass methods,
* boot manipulation,
* persistent control mechanisms,
* decision automation,
* AI or optimization systems.

Any system exhibiting such properties is **not derived from this prior art**.

---

## 10. Novelty Statement

Novelty arises from the **specific combination** of:

* frame-less field computation,
* BIOS-phase residency,
* cyclic color-based projection,
* total absence of persistence and control,
* firmware treated as projection space rather than authority.

No known prior system discloses this combination as a unified architecture.

---

## 11. Defensive Publication Clause

All concepts described herein are intentionally placed in the **public domain as prior art**.

Any attempt to claim exclusive rights — including patents or functionally equivalent protections — over:

* BIOS-resident field projection,
* hexFRAmeLESs BIOS implementations,
* hexBIOsWARe,
* or direct isomorphic derivations thereof,

is incompatible with this disclosure.

---

## 12. Declaration

This document is disclosed in good faith for transparency, clarity, and the prevention of monopolization of foundational computational structures.

The system claims **no authority**.
It reflects structure only.
