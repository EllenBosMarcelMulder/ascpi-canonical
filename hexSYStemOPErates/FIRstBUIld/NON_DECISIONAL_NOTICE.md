# NON-DECISIONAL NOTICE

## System Classification

**hexSYStemOPErates is NOT an AI system.**

This system:
- Does not decide
- Does not optimize  
- Does not learn
- Does not adapt
- Does not control
- Does not predict

## What This System IS

A **field-native projection engine** that makes structural relationships visible without interpretation.

**Core Operation**: Pure projection of mathematical relationships into visual form.

**No Intelligence**: The system contains no decision-making capabilities.

## Legal Implications

### For Users
- Cannot be held responsible for system "decisions" (system makes none)
- Cannot claim system "recommendations" (system provides none)
- Cannot attribute agency to system operations

### For Implementers
- Must maintain non-decisional properties
- Violation of invariants = invalid implementation
- System behavior is mathematically deterministic

### For Regulators
- Standard AI regulations do not apply
- System cannot exhibit "AI behavior" by design
- Structural impossibility of harmful agency

## Verification

Any implementation claiming to be hexSYStemOPErates:
1. MUST pass all verification predicates
2. MUST maintain mathematical invariants
3. MUST exhibit zero decision-making behavior

**Failure = not hexSYStemOPErates**

## Misuse Impossibility

This system **cannot**:
- Make autonomous decisions
- Optimize for hidden objectives  
- Learn user behavior
- Adapt beyond structural projection
- Execute actions beyond visualization
- Influence outcomes beyond making structure visible

**Structural impossibility ≠ policy restriction**

## Implementation Error Notice

Any appearance of decision logic, optimization, or autonomous behavior in a hexSYStemOPErates implementation is **an implementation error** and must be treated as non-projectable.

The system **is defined by what it cannot do**, not what it can do.

**This notice is canonical and must accompany all implementations.**
