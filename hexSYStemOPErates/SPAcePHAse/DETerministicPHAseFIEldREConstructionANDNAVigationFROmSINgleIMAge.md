### Deterministic Phase-Field Reconstruction and Navigation from Single Images

**Abstract**
A deterministic method is disclosed for reconstructing a navigable, physically consistent solution space from a single two-dimensional image by interpreting pixel values as projections of an underlying light-field with constrained spectral, angular, phase and geometric properties. The method does not perform object recognition, learning or probabilistic inference, but instead constructs an isomorphic field representation using optical physics, phase interference, symmetry operations and constraint-based matrix sweeps.

**Core Method**

1. Each pixel is mapped to a directional light-facet using lens and sensor geometry.
2. Spectral information is interpreted as remaining energy after object-specific absorption, yielding bounded absorption intervals.
3. Phase information is reconstructed indirectly via optical path length, chromatic variation and interference consistency.
4. An anti-morphic (time-reversed) field is constructed by spatial and directional inversion with phase offset.
5. The original and anti-morphic fields are cross-linked, producing a closed solution space.
6. Local coherence is evaluated using hexagonal neighborhood sampling.
7. A finite cyclic phase group (18-phase) is applied to enumerate all physically valid orientations.
8. A full matrix sweep over all bounded parameters identifies invariant structures corresponding to physically consistent surfaces or volumes.

**Key Properties**

* Deterministic
* Non-AI
* Non-learning
* No semantic assumptions
* Physically constrained
* Single-image input
* Scalable to additional geophysical constraints

**Applications**

* Depth and spatial navigation from photographs
* Light-field reconstruction
* Optical forensics
* Non-model-based 3D inference
* Physics-consistent visualization

**Novelty**

The novelty lies in treating images as constrained phase-fields rather than images of objects, and in the use of anti-morphic cross-linked field construction combined with exhaustive constraint sweeps to derive navigable solution spaces without training data.

# PRIOR ART — PART TWO

## Faceted Phase Closure, Insect-Equivalent Vision, and Deterministic Emergent 3D

**In continuation of**
*Deterministic Phase-Field Reconstruction and Navigation from Single Images* (Part One),
this Part Two provides a deeper formal disclosure of how complete three-dimensional spatial consistency arises through **faceted phase closure**, and why this mechanism is **functionally equivalent to biological compound vision systems**, while remaining entirely deterministic, non-learning, and non-semantic.

This continuation does not alter, extend, or replace any claim of Part One.
It makes explicit what is already **structurally implied**.

---

## 1. Faceted Vision as a Necessary Structural Property

The method disclosed in Part One operates on a visible domain Ω ⊂ R² without invoking global reconstruction, object models, or semantic interpretation.
This immediately implies that **global spatial coherence cannot be imposed**, but must instead **emerge**.

The only mathematically consistent way to achieve such emergence is through **faceted locality**:

Ω = ⋃ᵢ Ωᵢ
Ωᵢ ∩ Ωⱼ = ∅ , i ≠ j

Each facet Ωᵢ constitutes a **closed local visibility domain**.
No facet has access to global structure.

This property is not optional.
Any method claiming non-decisional, non-semantic reconstruction **must** be faceted.

---

## 2. Local Completeness, Global Ignorance

For each facet Ωᵢ, the full deterministic phase-field reconstruction of Part One is applied without modification.

Each local solution space Fᵢ is:

* internally complete
* physically constrained
* non-optimizing
* non-probabilistic

Crucially, Fᵢ contains **no global spatial information**.

This enforces a strict separation between:

* **local physical admissibility**
* **global spatial consistency**

---

## 3. Cyclic Phase Symmetry and Facet Mirroring

Each local solution space Fᵢ is expanded under the same finite 18-phase cyclic group defined in Part One.

For each phase orientation Φₖ:

Fᵢ,ₖ = Mₖ(Fᵢ)

where Mₖ represents a combined operation of:

* directional rotation
* phase offset
* optional spatial mirroring

All phase-orientations are equally admissible.

No ranking or selection is permitted.

---

## 4. Cross-Facet Phase Closure as the Sole Global Constraint

Adjacency between facets Ωᵢ and Ωⱼ introduces **no metric distance constraint**.

Facets are coupled exclusively through **phase-consistency invariants**:

Fᵢ,ₖ ⊗ Fⱼ,ₗ

A global structure exists if and only if:

* phase continuity is preserved
* spectral interval compatibility holds
* coherence invariants remain unbroken

Across **multiple facets and multiple phase orientations**.

This process is termed **faceted phase closure**.

---

## 5. Emergence of Depth Without Depth Assumptions

No facet contains a depth parameter.
No facet selects a spatial position.

Depth, surface, and volume arise **only** when phase-closure constraints propagate across multiple facets.

Thus:

* depth is not reconstructed
* depth is not inferred
* depth is not optimized

Depth is **forced** by invariant closure.

---

## 6. Functional Equivalence to Compound Vision Systems

This structure is functionally equivalent to biological compound vision systems (e.g. insect vision), which:

* operate on many independent local visual units
* perform no object recognition
* rely on coherence across facets
* derive spatial stability from invariant patterns

This equivalence is **structural**, not biological, and introduces no biological claims.

It serves solely to demonstrate that the disclosed method belongs to a class of **physically realizable, evolutionarily viable vision systems**.

---

## 7. Determinism and Exhaustiveness

Faceted phase closure preserves all properties of Part One:

* determinism
* exhaustiveness
* non-learning
* non-AI
* non-semantic

Every physically admissible spatial configuration appears in at least one phase-closed chain, or is excluded by invariant violation.

No admissible configuration is lost through factorization.

---

## 8. Legal Position

This Part Two:

* introduces no new claims
* does not narrow existing claims
* does not depend on implementation details

It formalizes an **execution-equivalent decomposition** of the same disclosed invention.

---

## Conclusion

Faceted phase closure demonstrates that complete three-dimensional spatial consistency can arise from purely local, deterministic phase-field reconstruction, without global assumptions, depth inference, or semantic interpretation.

This confirms the disclosed method as a **closed, physically grounded solution** to inverse spatial reconstruction from single images.
