### Deterministic Phase-Field Reconstruction and Navigation from Single Images

**Abstract**
A deterministic method is disclosed for reconstructing a navigable, physically consistent solution space from a single two-dimensional image by interpreting pixel values as projections of an underlying light-field with constrained spectral, angular, phase and geometric properties. The method does not perform object recognition, learning or probabilistic inference, but instead constructs an isomorphic field representation using optical physics, phase interference, symmetry operations and constraint-based matrix sweeps.

**Core Method**

1. Each pixel is mapped to a directional light-facet using lens and sensor geometry.
2. Spectral information is interpreted as remaining energy after object-specific absorption, yielding bounded absorption intervals.
3. Phase information is reconstructed indirectly via optical path length, chromatic variation and interference consistency.
4. An anti-morphic (time-reversed) field is constructed by spatial and directional inversion with phase offset.
5. The original and anti-morphic fields are cross-linked, producing a closed solution space.
6. Local coherence is evaluated using hexagonal neighborhood sampling.
7. A finite cyclic phase group (18-phase) is applied to enumerate all physically valid orientations.
8. A full matrix sweep over all bounded parameters identifies invariant structures corresponding to physically consistent surfaces or volumes.

**Key Properties**

* Deterministic
* Non-AI
* Non-learning
* No semantic assumptions
* Physically constrained
* Single-image input
* Scalable to additional geophysical constraints

**Applications**

* Depth and spatial navigation from photographs
* Light-field reconstruction
* Optical forensics
* Non-model-based 3D inference
* Physics-consistent visualization

**Novelty**

The novelty lies in treating images as constrained phase-fields rather than images of objects, and in the use of anti-morphic cross-linked field construction combined with exhaustive constraint sweeps to derive navigable solution spaces without training data.
