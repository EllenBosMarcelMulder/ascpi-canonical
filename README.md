# ASCπ Canonical Field Compiler

**ASCπ Canonical Field Compiler** is a deterministic semantic field compiler implementing the **Hybrid Engine Laughing Loop (HELL)**.
It operates on closed, non-stochastic field dynamics and produces **reproducible Field Native Operators (FNO)**.

This repository contains the **canonical, frozen implementation** of the ASCπ core (v1.0 / v1.0.1), intended as a stable foundation for further development, research, and community collaboration.

## What This Is

* A **field-based compiler**, not an AI system
* Fully **deterministic** and **non-probabilistic**
* No machine learning, no neural networks, no optimization loops
* Governed by closed field dynamics:

  * ΔΦ (implosive tension)
  * κ (structural curvature)
  * θ (field phase)
  * C (coherence)

The system converges via intrinsic field laws toward a canonical attractor and emits a **Field Native Operator (FNO)** as output.

---

## What This Is *Not*

* ❌ Artificial Intelligence
* ❌ Machine Learning
* ❌ Gradient descent / backpropagation
* ❌ Probabilistic or heuristic computation
* ❌ A classical optimizing compiler

ASCπ must be understood as a **semantic field system**, not as a statistical or cognitive model.

---

## Repository Status

This repository represents:

* ✅ A **canonical reference implementation**
* ✅ A **tested and reproducible runtime**
* ✅ A **closed architectural core**

The following components are considered **frozen**:

* Canonical field equations
* Numerical integration method
* Core runtime behavior
* FNO output syntax

All extensions must occur **outside** the core.

> Their presence here does **not** imply novelty, but consolidation into a canonical, stable implementation.

## Community Start Point

This repository marks the **starting point of the ASCπ community**.

You are invited to:

* Explore the system
* Build tooling, UIs, and extensions
* Run experiments *around* the core
* Discuss implications and applications

What you may **not** do:

* Alter or reinterpret the canonical core as AI/ML
* Introduce stochastic behavior into the core
* Reframe the system as an optimizer or learning model

Community contributions should respect the **field-based paradigm** and the frozen canonical layer.

## Public Interest & Governance Context

This project implements a deterministic, auditable and reproducible field-based runtime architecture.
Its design principles align with requirements commonly applicable to public-sector systems,
including transparency, non-arbitrary behavior and verifiable decision pathways.

A non-normative legal and governance context note is provided in `/docs/governance/`.

## Final Note

ASCπ is not a product pitch.
It is not a promise.
It is a **working, deterministic system** — now made stable so others can safely build on it.

Welcome to the beginning.
