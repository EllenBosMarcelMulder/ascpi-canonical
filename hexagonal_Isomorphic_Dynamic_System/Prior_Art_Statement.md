## COVERED SUBJECT MATTER

### Core Structural Principle
Any system implementing:
- **Six-directional symmetrical configuration** with fixed mirror relationships
- **Automatic opposite-direction activation** upon perturbation  
- **Ratio-based dynamics** without absolute value dependency

- **Closed symbol set** with explicit forbidden constructs
- **Prefix-dependent formation rules** based on word count
- **Deterministic backward traceability** from any valid token

### Runtime Architecture
Any computational system demonstrating:
- **Post-state modular execution** without persistent memory
- **Field-based component interaction** without direct interfaces
- **Real-time structural visualization** as measurement, not simulation
- **Deterministic behavior** without conditional branching or optimization

### Isomorphic Projection Stack
Any implementation providing:
- **Form-identical representations** across multiple descriptive layers
