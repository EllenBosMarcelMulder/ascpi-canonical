# ASCπ Roadmap

This roadmap describes **intended directions**, not promises.
The canonical core is complete; future work focuses on ecosystem growth.

---

## Phase 0 — Canonical Stabilization (Completed)

- Canonical core frozen
- Deterministic runtime validated
- Prior art documented
- Tests formalized
- Architecture published

**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Phase 1 — Tooling & Visibility

Focus: making the system understandable and explorable.

Planned:
- Field state inspectors
- Convergence visualizers
- Runtime trace tools
- Improved demo projectors

Core remains untouched.

---

## Phase 2 — Extension Ecosystem

Focus: enabling safe third-party development.

Planned:
- Extension templates
- Adapter examples
- External system bridges
- Deterministic data pipelines

---

## Phase 3 — Documentation & Education

Focus: long-term comprehension.

Planned:
- Tutorials
- Conceptual guides
- Mathematical walkthroughs
- Recorded explanations

---

## Phase 4 — Research & Exploration (Outside Core)

Focus: parallel research, not core changes.

Possible directions:
- Alternative projectors
- Comparative studies
- Theoretical extensions (separate repos)
- Domain-specific applications

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

ASCπ will **not**:
- become an AI framework
- introduce learning or optimization
- chase performance benchmarks
- sacrifice clarity for novelty

---

## Closing Note

The roadmap favors **depth over speed**.
Stability is the prerequisite for everything else.
